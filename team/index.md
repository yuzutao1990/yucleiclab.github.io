# Meet Our Team

We’re a new research group, based at the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), A*STAR. We're always keen to hear from talented and curious scientists, visiting students, and visiting scholars interested in joining the lab!

Dr. Zutao Yu is interested in nucleic acids chemical biology. His work bridges chemical biology and genomic medicine. He is interested in elucidating the roles of the epigenome and (epi-) transcriptome in both physiological and pathological conditions and developing strategies to manipulate them by targeting DNA and RNA. He uses advanced chemical biology techniques, such as drug-chromatin interaction detection, bifunctional molecules, in-situ on-target drug screening, and next-generation sequencing. His future research aims to innovate transcriptome- and genome-targeting strategies for modulating functional genomics in disease contexts like cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders.
